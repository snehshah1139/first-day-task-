**DATA SET OVERVIEW:**
Urban traffic congestion is one of the most pressing challenges faced by modern cities, impacting daily lives, fuel efficiency, and overall productivity. In this project, I have crafted a synthetic yet realistic dataset that reflects real-time traffic behavior across different locations and time frames.

The core goal of this task is to transform raw, messy data into a clean, structured format that is ready for machine learning models. This involves identifying missing values, handling inconsistencies, encoding categorical data, normalizing features, and removing outliersâ€”all with a focus on clarity, precision, and performance.

Objective: To simulate a real-world traffic prediction environment using structured preprocessing techniques and establish a solid foundation for ML-based traffic congestion forecasting.

Key Highlights of My Approach:

Developed a context-rich dataset inspired by real urban traffic challenges.
Applied meaningful preprocessing aligned with industry practices.
Maintained high readability and modularity for reproducibility.
Ensured every transformation step is justified with visual and statistical support.
ðŸŽ¯ Mission: To not only complete the task, but to deliver a solution that is distinctive, insightful, and deployable, standing out among 500+ submissions with excellence in both code quality and problem understanding.

**SUMMARY**
Imported and Explored Dataset: Loaded the dataset and analyzed basic information such as null values and data types to understand the structure of the data.

Handled Missing Values: Applied techniques like mean, median, or imputation to fill in missing values, ensuring the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.

Converted Categorical Features: Used encoding techniques to convert categorical features into numerical format, making the data suitable for machine learning models.

Normalized/Standardized Numerical Features: Applied normalization or standardization techniques to scale the numerical features, ensuring that they have a uniform range for better model performance.

Visualized and Removed Outliers: Used boxplots to visualize outliers and removed them to prevent them from skewing the analysis and model results
